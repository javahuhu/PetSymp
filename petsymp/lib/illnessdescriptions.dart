    "Periodontal disease is a serious dental problem in cats that starts with gum inflammation (gingivitis) and can progress to infection, bone loss, and eventually tooth loss. It’s one of the most common conditions in adult cats and often goes unnoticed until it’s advanced."
  ],
  "Severity": ["Mild to Severe – Can range from gum redness to tooth and bone loss"],
  "Treatment": [
    "Your cat may need a **professional dental cleaning** under anesthesia, including **scaling and polishing** to remove plaque and tartar.",
    "If teeth are loose or infected, your vet may perform **root planing** or **tooth extractions**.",
    "**Daily tooth brushing** with cat-safe toothpaste can help control plaque at home.",
    "**Chlorhexidine rinses or gels** may be used to reduce bacteria in the mouth.",
    "For long-term care, your vet might recommend **dental diets or special dental chews**."
  ],
  "Causes": [
    "Periodontal disease is caused by **plaque buildup** along the gum line. The body’s immune response to this bacteria leads to inflammation and tissue damage over time."
  ],
  "Transmission": [
    "Not directly contagious – it doesn’t spread from cat to cat."
  ],
  "Diagnosis": [
    "Your vet will do a **dental exam under anesthesia**, checking the gums and probing around the teeth.",
    "**Dental X-rays** may be taken to see if there is any bone loss that isn’t visible on the surface."
  ],
  "What To Do": [
    "Schedule a **yearly dental cleaning** (COHAT – Comprehensive Oral Health Assessment and Treatment).",
    "Start **brushing your cat’s teeth daily** with a finger brush or soft pet toothbrush.",
    "Use **vet-approved dental rinses** or chews to reduce bacteria and plaque buildup.",

    "Don’t wait—**early treatment** can prevent pain, infection, and tooth loss."
  ],
  "Recovery Time": [
    "**Gum inflammation** improves within about **a week** after cleaning.",
    "**Bone loss** from advanced disease is **permanent**, but regular care can stop it from getting worse."
  ],
  "Risk Factors": [
    "Cats with **flat faces** (like Persians), **small jaws**, or those who eat mostly **wet food** are at higher risk.",
    "Cats that **don’t receive regular brushing** are more likely to develop dental disease."

"Rabies in Cats": {
  "Description": [
    "Rabies is a deadly virus that attacks the brain and nervous system. Once symptoms appear—like sudden changes in behavior, paralysis, or seizures—it is always fatal. Rabies is one of the most serious diseases a cat (or human) can get, and death usually occurs within a few days of symptoms starting."
  ],
  "Severity": ["Critical – 100% Fatal after symptoms appear"],
  "Treatment": [
    "Unfortunately, there is **no treatment** once clinical signs begin.",
    "Cats suspected of having rabies are either **quarantined under strict conditions** or **humanely euthanized**, depending on local laws.",
    "This is a **public health emergency**, not just a veterinary concern."
  ],
  "Causes": [
    "Rabies is most often spread through the **bite of an infected wild animal**, such as a bat, raccoon, skunk, or fox.",
    "It can also be spread by **unvaccinated pets** that were exposed to the virus and later bite others."
  ],
  "Transmission": [
    "The virus spreads when **infected saliva enters the body**, usually through **bites or scratches**.",
    "It can also spread if saliva gets into **open wounds or mucous membranes** (like the eyes or mouth)."
  ],
  "Diagnosis": [
    "The only way to confirm rabies is by testing **brain tissue after death** (called a dFA test).",
    "**There is no reliable test while the animal is still alive**."
  ],
  "What To Do": [
    "If you suspect rabies, **immediately report the case** to your local animal or public health authorities.",
    "**Do not handle** the animal—avoid any contact to reduce human risk.",
    "If a person or another pet was exposed, follow **post-exposure treatment protocols** right away.",
    "Authorities will **guide the next steps**, which may include quarantine or testing."
  ],
  "Recovery Time": [
    "Once symptoms start, the disease progresses quickly—**death usually occurs within 2 to 10 days**."
  ],
  "Risk Factors": [
    "Cats that go **outdoors and are not vaccinated** are at high risk.",
    "Areas with **wildlife known to carry rabies** (like raccoons or bats) have increased risk."
  ],
  "Prevention": [
    "**Keep your cat up to date on rabies vaccinations** — it’s required by law in most areas.",

"Roundworms in Cats": {
  "Description": [
    "Roundworms are large intestinal parasites that can live inside your cat’s digestive system. They can cause a bloated belly, poor growth in kittens, and sometimes worms may be seen in vomit or poop. These worms can also spread to humans, especially children, and may cause serious illness if ingested."
  ],
  "Severity": ["Mild to Moderate – Can be more serious in kittens or high worm loads"],
  "Treatment": [
    "**Pyrantel pamoate** is commonly used to kill roundworms and is given every 2 weeks in young kittens.",

    "If worms are seen in vomit or stool, your vet may recommend repeating treatment and testing all cats in the household."
  ],
  "Causes": [
    "Kittens can get roundworms **from their mother’s milk** (transmammary transmission).",
    "Cats of any age can get infected by **eating contaminated soil**, **licking dirty paws**, or **catching rodents** that carry worm larvae."
  ],
  "Transmission": [
    "Roundworm eggs are spread through **feces** and can survive in soil for **years**.",
    "They are **zoonotic**, meaning people (especially children) can also become infected by accidentally swallowing contaminated soil or pet fur."
  ],
  "Diagnosis": [
    "A **stool test** (fecal flotation) checks for the presence of roundworm eggs.",
    "Sometimes **adult worms** are visible in vomit or poop — they look like spaghetti noodles."
  ],
  "What To Do": [
    "Begin **deworming kittens at 2 weeks old** and continue every 2 weeks until 3 months of age.",
    "Clean the litter box **daily** and **sanitize the area** to reduce reinfection risk.",
    "Make sure the **mother cat is treated** at the same time to prevent passing worms to kittens.",

"Stomatitis in Cats": {
  "Description": [
    "Stomatitis is a painful and severe inflammation inside the mouth. Cats with this condition often drool, have bad breath, and may avoid eating because it hurts. It’s a chronic condition that can be hard to manage and greatly affects your cat’s quality of life if not treated properly."
  ],
  "Severity": ["Severe – Debilitating and very painful"],
  "Treatment": [
    "The most effective treatment is **full-mouth or caudal-mouth tooth extractions**. Removing the teeth can drastically reduce inflammation and pain.",

    "If inflammation continues after extractions, your vet may prescribe **immunosuppressive medications** like **cyclosporine** or **steroids**.",
    "For cats that carry the **calicivirus (FCV)**, **antiviral medication** may help reduce flare-ups.",
    "After surgery, cats should be fed **soft food** and monitored closely for comfort and weight gain."
  ],
  "Causes": [
    "Stomatitis is believed to be an **overreaction of the immune system to dental plaque**.",
    "It’s often linked to underlying **viral infections**, especially **feline calicivirus (FCV)**, **feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV)**, or **feline leukemia virus (FeLV)**."
  ],
  "Transmission": [
    "The **stomatitis itself is not contagious**, but **FCV**, a common underlying virus, **is contagious** to other cats."
  ],
  "Diagnosis": [
    "Your vet will examine the mouth and look for **angry red inflammation** (mucositis) that goes beyond the gums.",
    "A **biopsy** may be done to rule out other conditions like **eosinophilic granuloma** or **oral cancer (SCC)**."

"Tapeworms in Cats": {
  "Description": [
    "Tapeworms are intestinal parasites that live inside a cat’s gut. They usually don’t cause serious illness, but you may notice small, white, rice-like pieces (called segments) near your cat’s rear end or in their bedding. Some cats may also have a mild upset stomach or itchiness around the anus."
  ],
  "Severity": ["Mild – Usually more annoying than harmful, but can return without prevention"],
  "Treatment": [
    "**Praziquantel**, given either as an **oral tablet** or **injection**, is the most common and effective treatment.",
    "**Epsiprantel** is another option your vet may prescribe.",
    "To stop the worms from coming back, your cat also needs **flea treatment** (for Dipylidium) or **rodent control** (for Taenia).",
    "**Treat all pets in the household** and clean the home environment if fleas are present."
  ],
  "Causes": [
    "Cats get tapeworms by **eating infected fleas** (most common) or by **hunting and eating rodents** that carry the parasite."
  ],
  "Transmission": [
    "Tapeworms don’t spread directly from cat to cat — they require an **intermediate host**, like a **flea** or **rodent**, to infect a new cat."
  ],
  "Diagnosis": [
    "**Rice-like segments** (called proglottids) may be seen around the anus or in the stool.",
    "A **stool test** (fecal flotation) may show eggs, but it doesn’t always catch them — visible segments are often the best clue."
  ],
  "What To Do": [
    "**Give a deworming treatment** like praziquantel as soon as segments are seen.",
    "**Start or update flea prevention** right away to break the life cycle and prevent reinfection.",
    "If your cat hunts, try to **limit outdoor activity** or discourage hunting to avoid Taenia-type tapeworms.",
    "**Clean bedding and vacuum** thoroughly to remove fleas and eggs from the environment."
  ],
  "Recovery Time": [
    "Most cats are clear of visible worm segments within **24 hours of treatment**.",
